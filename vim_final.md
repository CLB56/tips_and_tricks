A. Installs with apt

As usually first
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt upgrade

Then all the apt install i will need :
- sudo apt install python3-pip

NB : This is the only python package that i plan to install with apt.
I was for sure interested in installing directly with apt pipdeptree but this package seems much less often updated
All other python packages will be installed with pip.

- sudo apt install pandoc

NB : Here i should do test to see if i don't need to install suggested packages with pandoc : 
  texlive-latex-recommended texlive-xetex texlive-luatex pandoc-citeproc texlive-latex-extra context wkhtmltopdf librsvg2-bin groff ghc nodejs php python ruby r-base-core libjs-mathjax node-katex

B. Vim configuration
